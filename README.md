# CocktailsTest

This a test in Android

Instructions:

Please test the branch "development".

Questions:

A) R/ I used Retrofit. So, with ViewModel I consume the date via Retrofit.

B) R/ I used the approach 1 Activity, N fragments. It is the new approach encouraged by Google (check codelabs).

C) R/ Yes. Tell to the backend developer to make a good work. It's not possible that I have to spend time consuming an entire endpoint just to display ingredients inside an adapter.

On my end, I used RecyclerView instead of ListView. 

D) R/ No.
